Write a program that creates tic-tac-toe. 
Write a program that prints a grid like the following one:
||  ||   ||  ||   ||  ||
||  ||   ||  ||   ||  ||
||  ||   ||  ||   ||  ||
Two players play at turns and they have to choose a position in the grid.
The position is chosen using the terminal and each player needs to provide a number,
from 1 to 9. To each number there is a corresponding position in the grid, as follows:
|| 1 ||   || 2 ||   || 3 ||
|| 4 ||   || 5 ||   || 6 ||
|| 7 ||   || 8 ||   || 9 ||
For example, if player 1 (with X), at turn 1 chooses position 1, the grid will look like this:
|| X ||   ||   ||   ||   ||
||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||
||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||
Then, if player 2 (with O) chooses position 8, the grid will look like this:
|| X ||   ||   ||   ||   ||
||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||
||   ||   || O ||   ||   ||
The game ends when one of the two players is able to allign their own marker on three different cells or when 
it is impossible for any player to win
